# SayBale
A quick and simple chatroom in Node.JS.

----
## What is SayBale?
SayBale is a website that was made to test the abilities of the DynaSite HTTP server also made in Node.JS.

## What is DynaSite?
It's a dynamic HTTP subpage server made for SayBale. It is inside the folder `web` and SayBale's dynamic
files are `web/pages/*.node.js`.

## How to run SayBale?
First, get [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org).

In a Command Prompt (Windows, not tested on Linux):

- `cd` to the `web` folder where you downloaded/cloned the repository
- `node main.js`

## My chat does not work!
SayBale is still in a testing stage and isn't very functional yet.
